# Designing a MPC Controller with Simulink 💻👨🏻‍💻

• Designed and implemented an Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller block in Simulink, incorporating a cost
function and tuning parameters to optimize performance.<br/>
• Conducted extensive simulations and real-time testing, demonstrating the MPC controller’s superior performance
and robustness compared to traditional control strategies.<br/>
